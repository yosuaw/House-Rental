This information system offers a method of renting a house that is modern, fast, safe and reliable. You can access our information system through 2 platforms, through the website and through the application. Both of them use the Java Web Service which is connected to the database, so that your data is guaranteed to be secure. There are 6 choices of houses that are ready for you to rent, and of course these houses have clear information because they have been selected by our trusted agents.

First of all, if you want to make a rental through the website or application, you need to log in first. What if you don't have an account? Relax, you can register an account through the website or application. After logging in, you can immediately communicate with our administrator via chat or telephone. We use the TCP protocol for the chat feature, while for the call feature, we use the UDP protocol. Our chat feature uses TCP because it requires reliable communication, orderly chat data, and to ensure that chats from client to admin or vice versa, can arrive properly. Meanwhile, our call feature uses UDP because the call process requires fast data transfer

You can consult the house you want to rent with our admin. Through the chat feature, you can also check rental dates, view lists of homes for rent, make house reservations/rents, and track reservations that you have made. If you may feel that it is unclear communicating via chat, you can call our admin via the call feature that we have provided. If you want to see a picture of the front view of the list of houses for rent, you can see it on our website. In addition, if you want to know chat history or want to know about reservations that have been made, there is a feature to see that. We record every chat of your consultation with the admin along with the reservation that you have successfully made.
